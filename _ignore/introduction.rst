Introduction
------------
The following figure (indicating a single iteration for updating and optimizing algorithms) demonstrates a typical pipline for the LLM-based altomatic algorithm design methods.
The solutions of LLM4AD are represented as executable functions.

The main logic of this canonical paradigm can be grouped into four parts:

1. Maintaining a solution set, which contains multiple candidate solutions.

2. Select multiple candidate solution (may in favor of that with higher performance scores) and create prompt using prompt engineering.

3. Query LLM and process the response content (extract the code of algorithm from the response content).

4. Evaluate (with secure evaluation technique) the algorithm and update the solution set.

-----------------
This repository implements state-of-the-art large language model based evlutionary program search (LLM-EPS) methods. We have implemented four LLM based EPS methods as follows.

.. note::
    "*": The implementation has some minor differences from the original method (demonstrated in their original paper), considering generality and multithreading acceleration.

.. tip::
    We also provide LLM-free examples to help understanding/building the pipeline of these methods!

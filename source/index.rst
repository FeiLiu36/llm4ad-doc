+-------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. note::
    üí°: The implementation has some minor differences from the original method (demonstrated in their original paper), considering generality and multithreading acceleration.

.. tip::
    We also provide LLM-free examples to help understanding/building the pipeline of these methods!

üìùAbout (do we add this?)
--------------------------
- This framework is powered by anyoptimization, a Python research community. It is developed and maintained by Julian Blank who is affiliated to the Computational Optimization and Innovation Laboratory (COIN) supervised by Kalyanmoy Deb at the Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, USA.

- We have developed the framework for research purposes and hope to contribute to the research area by delivering tools for solving and analyzing multi-objective problems. Each algorithm is developed as close as possible to the proposed version to the best of our knowledge. NSGA-II and NSGA-III have been developed collaboratively with one of the authors and, therefore, we recommend using them for official benchmarks.

- If you intend to use our framework for any profit-making purposes, please contact us. Also, be aware that even state-of-the-art algorithms are just the starting point for many optimization problems. The full potential of genetic algorithms requires customization and the incorporation of domain knowledge. We have experience for more than 20 years in the optimization field and are eager to tackle challenging problems. Let us know if you are interested in working with experienced collaborators in optimization. Please keep in mind that only through such projects can we keep developing and improving our framework and making sure it meets the industry‚Äôs current needs.

- Moreover, any kind of contribution is more than welcome:
    1. Give us a star on GitHub. This makes not only our framework but, in general, multi-objective optimization more accessible by being listed with a higher rank regarding specific keywords.
    2. To offer more and more new algorithms and features, we are more than happy if somebody wants to contribute by developing code. You can see it as a win-win situation because your development will be linked to your publication(s), which can significantly increase your work awareness. Please note that we aim to keep a high level of code quality, and some refactoring might be suggested.
    3. You like our framework, and you would like to use it for profit-making purposes? We are always searching for industrial collaborations because they help direct research to meet the industry‚Äôs needs. Our laboratory solving practical problems have a high priority for every student and can help you benefit from the research experience we have gained over the last years.

- If you find a bug or you have any kind of concern regarding the correctness, please use our Issue Tracker Nobody is perfect Moreover, only if we are aware of the issues we can start to investigate them.
